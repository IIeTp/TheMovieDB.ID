# TheMovieDB.ID
This agent is based on the original `TheMovieDB` plugin. For the improvement of the code, thanks go to Reyter.

The main differences from the original version:
- Added the ability to use the movie ID or TV show instead of the name or in addition to it.
- Added the ability to use ID from [FileBot Xattr Metadata](https://github.com/filebot/plex-agents).
